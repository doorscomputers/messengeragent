## 🎥 Critical Video Requirement

**The #1 reason for rejection was:**
> "Failed to showcase the end-to-end process of sending and receiving messages from app to messenger user inbox"

**Your video MUST show:**
1. Typing a message in your app at `/messaging-demo`
2. Clicking "Send"
3. **Switching to Facebook Messenger (web or mobile)**
4. **The message appearing in the Messenger inbox**
5. Timestamp and delivery status visible

**This is non-negotiable.** Facebook reviewers need visual proof that messages actually reach the Messenger inbox.
