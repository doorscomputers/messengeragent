# üìä Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Sheets integration for automatic order and lead logging.

## Overview

The spreadsheet integration automatically logs:
- **Orders**: Customer orders with details, status, and lead scores
- **Leads**: Customer leads with scoring, buying stage, and tags
- **Analytics**: Daily analytics reports with conversion tracking

## Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

## Step 2: Create Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "Service Account"
3. Fill in service account details:
   - Name: `fb-messenger-agent`
   - Description: `Service account for FB Messenger Agent spreadsheet integration`
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip role assignment (click "Continue")
6. Click "Done"

## Step 3: Generate Credentials

1. Find your service account in the credentials list
2. Click on the service account email
3. Go to "Keys" tab
4. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key"
5. Choose "JSON" format
6. Click "Create" - this downloads the credentials file

## Step 4: Create Google Spreadsheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Name it something like "FB Messenger Agent Data"
4. Share the spreadsheet with your service account:
   - Click "Share" button
   - Add your service account email (from the credentials file)
   - Give "Editor" permissions
   - Uncheck "Notify people"
   - Click "Share"
5. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL:
   - URL format: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit`

## Step 5: Configure Integration

1. Copy the configuration template:
   ```bash
   cp spreadsheet-config.template.json spreadsheet-config.json
   ```

2. Open `spreadsheet-config.json` and update:

   ```json
   {
     "google_sheets": {
       "enabled": true,
       "credentials": {
         // Paste the contents of your downloaded JSON credentials file here
       },
       "spreadsheet_id": "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE",
       "backup_enabled": true,
       "backup_interval_hours": 24
     },
     "analytics": {
       "enabled": true,
       "daily_reports": true,
       "conversion_tracking": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace the credentials object with your actual service account credentials
4. Replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE` with your actual spreadsheet ID

## Step 6: Restart the Application

1. Restart your FB Messenger Agent:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Check the console for success messages:
   ```
   üìä Initializing Google Sheets integration...
   ‚úÖ Created sheet: Orders
   ‚úÖ Created sheet: Leads
   ‚úÖ Created sheet: Analytics
   ‚úÖ Google Sheets integration enabled
   ```

## Step 7: Test the Integration

1. Send a test message through your Facebook Messenger bot
2. Check your Google Spreadsheet - you should see:
   - New lead entry in "Leads" sheet
   - If it's an order, entry in "Orders" sheet
   - Daily analytics in "Analytics" sheet
